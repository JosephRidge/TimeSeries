It looked like it could be stationary, but earthquakes are very damaging. If you want to make predictions about them you better be sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that if it were not stationary this would mean that the number of earthquakes per year has a trend and is changing. This would be terrible news if it is trending upwards, as it means more damage. It would also be terrible news if it were trending downwards, it might suggest the core of our planet is changing and this could have lots of knock on effects for us!\n",
