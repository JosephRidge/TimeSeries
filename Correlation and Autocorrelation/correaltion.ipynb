    "Investors are often interested in the correlation between the returns of two different assets for asset allocation and hedging purposes. In this exercise, you'll try to answer the question of whether stocks are positively or negatively correlated with bonds. Scatter plots are also useful for visualizing the correlation between the two variables.\n",
